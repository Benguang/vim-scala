This is a "bundle" for Vim that builds off of the initial Scala plugin modules
by Stefan Matthias Aust and adds some more "stuff" that I find useful, including
all of my notes and customizations.

It's free for anyone to fork, clone, etc... no licensing or whatever... just do
whatever you want with it, but you can't take credit for my stuff :)
