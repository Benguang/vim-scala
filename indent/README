Scala Indent file for Vim
=========================

You can check 'testfile.scala' in this directory to see what I'm testing
against.  I'm mostly just trying to fit the major conventions that people would
code in with Scala, and not all of the possibilities - life's too short for that
and I'd rather be writing Scala code than Vim indent code.

With that said, if there's something you're passionate about and you want it to
be properly indented, and you can't hack it in yourself, then feel free to drop
me a line and we'll fight about it.

If you've got any questions about what's defined now, you can reach me at
