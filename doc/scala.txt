                                                *:SortScalaImports*
:SortScalaImports       Groups the imports a the top of the file and sorts
                        them alphabetically.
                        The three groups in which the imports can fall are:

                          1. Scala and Java core
                          2. Third party libraries
                          3. First party code (ie. your own)

                        Java and Scala core imports are identified by the
                        java(x) and scala namespaces.
                        Everything else that isn't a first party namespace
                        will be a third party import.
                        You can define a regex that matches first party
                        namespaces by setting

                          g:scala_first_party_namespaces

                        For example in a standard Play! app this would be
                        set to
                          g:scala_first_party_namespaces='\(controllers\|views\|models\)'
