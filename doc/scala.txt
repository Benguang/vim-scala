INTRODUCTION                                    *scala*

Syntax highlighting and helper functions for the scala language.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                        *scala-commands*

                                                *:SortScalaImports*
:SortScalaImports       There are two modes in which this command can operate.
                        By default it walks all import groups at the top of
                        the Scala file and orders their lines alphabetically.
                        A group is a series of lines starting with the
                        import keyword separated by one or more blank lines.

                        The second, more advanced mode, can be activated by
                        setting

                          let g:scala_sort_across_groups=1

                        This makes this command include all imports in the
                        sorting regardless of blank lines in between them and
                        puts them in three predefined groups instead.
                        The three groups in which the imports can fall are:

                          1. Scala and Java core
                          2. Third party libraries
                          3. First party code (ie. your own)

                        Java and Scala core imports are identified by the
                        java(x) and scala namespaces.
                        Everything else that isn't a first party namespace
                        will be a third party import.
                        You can define a regex that matches first party
                        namespaces by setting

                          g:scala_first_party_namespaces

                        For example in a standard Play app this would be
                        set to
                          g:scala_first_party_namespaces=
                             \ '\(controllers\|views\|models\)'

MAPPINGS                                        *scala-mappings*

Currently the only mappings defined are for FuzzyFinder users--these will
only be enabled if FuzzyFinder is detected.

                                                *scala-leader-fs*
<Leader>fs              "Find src". Primes |:FufFile| with `src/main/scala`,
                        and goes deeper still if only a single directory
                        exists below that. Helpful for package namespacing
                        like `src/main/scala/com/myorg`.

                                                *scala-leader-ft*
<Leader>ft              "Find test". Like |scala-leader-fs|, but with
                        `src/test/scala`.

                                                *scala-leader-fr*
<Leader>fr              "Find from root". For the rarer cases when you want to
                        start FuzzyFinder at project root (parent of `src/`).

Disabling Mappings~

If you wish to disable the default key mappings, write the following line in
your ~/.vimrc: >

    let g:scala_use_default_keymappings = 0
